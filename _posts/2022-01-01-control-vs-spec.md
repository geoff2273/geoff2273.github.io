title: In control and in spec

You sell a product; a prospective customer thinks it might be what they are looking for. Is it exactly what they need? Product specifications provide quantitative information to answer the question. Then, if you sell a batch of products outside of that specification, your customer is likely to complain. Mistakes like this should be rare but are ultimately unavoidable. Statistical process control (SPC) can help minimise losses by getting your manufacturing process "in control". 

Each important property of a product is given a specification, typically abbreviated to spec. The spec defines the minimum and maximum value that the property may take. For example, the volume of a can might nominally be 330ml, but no manufacturing process is capable of manufacturing cans with exactly the desired volume and every can will be slightly different. There are two processes that cause this to be. The first is bias (think "trend"). Tooling wear causes the volume to drift over time. At the start of the tooling lift-time the volume might be 325ml. Then as it wears the volume gradually drifts upwards until it reaches 335ml, at which point the tooling is replaced. The second process is variance (think noise). Imagine aiming at the bull's eye on a dart board. Sometimes you'll be high, sometimes you'll be low. Whether you were high or low for the previous throw doesn't help you know whether you'll be high or low for the next throw. So, the specification allows for these differences by requiring that the can must have a volume between 320ml and 340ml. This might be important to a filler, because they know that attempting to decant 325ml into the can could cause it to overflow. This is a contrived example, but it makes the point of why product specifications are important.

As a manufacturer, you want every property of every product you make to be within the specification. This is often stated as each product being "in spec". Unfortunately, this is impossible. Instead, the goal is to maximise the proportion of products that are in spec within the constraints of what is practicable. The most obvious way to ensure every product produced is in spec is to test every product. However, this effort must be absorbed into the cost of production, reducing profit margins or competitiveness. Fortunately, for high-volume manufacturing, it is usually possible to only test a small fraction of the products and apply statistics to confirm that an acceptably small fraction will be out of specification. What this fraction is depends on the product. For example, aerospace will tolerate a smaller fraction than most other industries because the consequences of being out-of-spec can be catastrophic. This is the idea behind SPC. When testing a small fraction of products it is essential to apply statistics rather than simply thinking that because the product last tested was in spec that all the products that weren't tested were also in spec. In the case of variance (noise), a high dart doesn't tell you if the next dart is high or low; an in spec product doesn't tell you if the next will be in or out of spec. In the case of bias (trend), an in spec product doesn't tell you that the next 10,000 you make before the next one you test will be in spec. 

To apply SPC, the manufacturing process must be "in control". This means that for each product that is tested, each property must have a value that is between the lower control limit and upper control limit. These control limits are determined from the statistics of the previously tested products. Conventionally, the control limits are calculated as the mean plus/minus three times the standard deviation. The factor of three is generally chosen because for a normal distribution 99.7% of samples fall within this interval. This works well for variance (noise) but further considerations need to be made for bias (trend). The percentage of products that have a particular property out of spec is then predictable by comparing the specification limits to the probability distribution for that property. 

Having the manufacturing process "in control" is essential to maxmimising the proportion of products that are "in spec". When a products property lies outside of the control limits the process is said to be out of control. In this case, it is necessary to investigate what caused the property to be too high or too low and take remedial action (if a cause is identified). Probabilistically, the likelihood of an out of control event even in a perfectly stable process is typically between 1/100 to 1/1,000, depending on the exact distribution. If only 1/10,000 products are tested, a stable process should require intervention on the order of 1/1,000,000 to 1/10,000,000 allowing large volumes with little overhead. 

So to summarise, specifications are guarantees made by the manufacturer to the customer, whereas control limits are calculated from the statistics of products that have been manufactured. Keeping your manufacturing process "in control" is a powerful way to ensure your products are "in spec".
