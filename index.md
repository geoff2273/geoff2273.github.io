The *Can Coating Meter* is a high-precision low-cost optical coating thickness gauge, with no need for refractive indices or density values from the coating supplier.

### Features

- Optical coating thickness gauge
- Disruptively low-cost
- Market-leading reliability
- High-precision readings
- Refractive indices and density are NOT required
- Measures decorated cans including black ink
- 24-month service interval
- Easy to use
- Comprehensive documentation
- Compact dimensions: 360 mm × 260 mm × 160 mm
- Ambient temperature operating range from 5 °C to 35 °C

#### Is the *Can Coating Meter* for you?

The *Can Coating Meter* meets the needs of the following users
- You control coating thickness in production by weighing samples and want to speed up your coating measurement
- You control coating thickness in production using a capacitive coating gauge and want the benefits of modern high-precision optical coating technology
- You have an automatic optical coating gauge and want to be able to verify the measurements when a can fails measurement
- You produce irregular sized cans that automatic gauges are unable to measure
- You are an R&D team and want complete flexibility of how you inspect the coating thickness
- Your existing coating gauge is unreliable, too expensive to maintain, or reached its end-of-life

#### Why is the *Can Coating Meter* so affordable?

The most expensive component of an optical coating gauge is the spectrometer. Our advanced algorithms enable coatings to be measured using a single vis-nir spectrometer even on decorated cans, achieving large cost-savings over longer-wavelength nir spectrometers that are more widely used.
