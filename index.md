The *Can Coating Meter* is the first optical coating thickness gauge available at a price comparable to capacitive coating thickness gaues, such as the Sencon SI9600. 

In addition to being very low-cost, the *Can Coating Meter* allows highly-precise repeatable measurements and market-leading reliability, with no need for refractive indices or dry density values from the coating supplier.

## Features

- Disruptively low-cost: optical gauges at capacitive gauge prices
- Market-leading reliability
- High-precision readings
- Refractive indices and dry density are NOT required
- 18-month service interval
- Easy to use
- Comprehensive documentation
