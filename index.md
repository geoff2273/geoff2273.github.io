excerpt: "The *Can Coating Meter* is the first optical coating thickness gauge available at a similar price to capacitive coating thickness gaues, like the Sencon SI9600. In addition to being low-cost compared to every other optical coating thickness gauge, the Coating Meter allows highly-precise repeatable measurements and market-leading reliability, with no need for refractive indices or dry density values from the coating supplier."
