  ## Can Coating Meter
  Optical coating thickness measurement

---

The *Can Coating Meter* is the first optical coating thickness gauge available at a price comparable to capacitive coating thickness gaues, such as the Sencon SI9600. 

In addition to being very low-cost, the *Can Coating Meter* allows highly-precise repeatable measurements and market-leading reliability, with no need for refractive indices or dry density values from the coating supplier.

#### Is the *Can Coating Meter* for you?

The *Can Coating Meter* meets the needs of the following users
- You control coating thickness in production by weighing samples and want to speed up your coating measurement
- You control coating thickness in production using a capacitive coating gauge (Sencon SI9600) and want the benefits of modern high-precision optical coating technology
- You have an automatic optical coating gauge (Torus Z340, Sencon Film-Scan) and want to be able to verify the measurements when a can fails measurement
- You produce irregular sized cans that automatic gauges are unable to measure
- You are an R&D team and want complete flexability of how you inspect the coating thickness
- Your existing coating gauge is unreliable, too expensive to maintain, or reached its end-of-life
#### How is the *Can Coating Meter* so affordable compared to other optical coatings gauges?

The *Can Coating Meter* uses commercial off-the-shelf hardware, saving the cost of developing expensive custom hardware, and ensuring you have reliable hardware from a market-leading manufacturer. We calibrate the hardware and provide our application-specific software to create the perfect product for optical coating measurement. 

The most expensive component of an optical coating gauge is the spectrometer (some Torus gauges even have two). Our advanced algorithms enable coatings to be measured using a single vis-nir spectrometer even on decorated cans, achieving large cost-savings over longer-wavelength nir spectrometers that are more widely used.
