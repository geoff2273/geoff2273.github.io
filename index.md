  Optical measurement of coating thickness 
---

{% include figure.html image="../assets/meter.jpg" width="1280" height="960" %}

The *Can Coating Meter* is the first optical coating thickness gauge available at a price comparable to capacitive coating thickness gauges, such as the Sencon SI9600. 

In addition to being very low-cost, the *Can Coating Meter* makes highly-precise repeatable measurements and market-leading reliability, with no need for refractive indices or density values from the coating supplier.

### Features

- Optical coating thickness gauge
- Disruptively low-cost: optical gauges at capacitive gauge prices
- Market-leading reliability
- High-precision readings
- Refractive indices and density are NOT required
- Measures decorated cans including black ink
- 18-month service interval
- Easy to use
- Comprehensive documentation
- Compact dimensions: 360 mm × 260 mm × 160 mm
- Ambient temperature operating range from 5 °C to 35 °C

#### Is the *Can Coating Meter* for you?

The *Can Coating Meter* meets the needs of the following users
- You control coating thickness in production by weighing samples and want to speed up your coating measurement
- You control coating thickness in production using a capacitive coating gauge (Sencon SI9600) and want the benefits of modern high-precision optical coating technology
- You have an automatic optical coating gauge (Torus Z340, Sencon Film-Scan) and want to be able to verify the measurements when a can fails measurement
- You produce irregular sized cans that automatic gauges are unable to measure
- You are an R&D team and want complete flexibility of how you inspect the coating thickness
- Your existing coating gauge is unreliable, too expensive to maintain, or reached its end-of-life

### Pricing

- $9999 (USD)
- €9499 (EUR)
- £7999 (GBP)

#### Why is the *Can Coating Meter* so affordable?

The *Can Coating Meter* uses commercial off-the-shelf components, avoiding the cost of developing expensive application-specific hardware, and provides the reliability of a market-leading manufacturer. We calibrate the hardware and add our application-specific software to create the perfect product for optical measurement of coating thickness. 

The most expensive component of an optical coating gauge is the spectrometer (some Torus gauges even have two). Our advanced algorithms enable coatings to be measured using a single vis-nir spectrometer even on decorated cans, achieving large cost-savings over longer-wavelength nir spectrometers that are more widely used.
